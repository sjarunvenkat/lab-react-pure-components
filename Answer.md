When we click the "Increment" or "Set Toggle" buttons, we will notice that the console.log statement in SimpleCounterComponent is printed on every re-render, even if the state or props haven't changed. On the other hand, the console.log statement in PureCounterComponent is printed only when the state or props have changed, which is because of the built-in shallow comparison logic in PureComponent.
